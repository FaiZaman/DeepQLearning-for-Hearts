# Greedy Agent

A better greedy agent can be created by first checking if hearts is broken
If true then choose biggest card, otherwise choose smallest card
If true choose biggest except for QoS
Riskier but better overall

# Action space

Modify the action space so that it only contains the values that the agent can legally play 
at the specific state - size 13 still, but keep some as -1 or 0 to determine which ones are usable

# Network inputs

Experiment with different inputs, eg [52, 13] or [1, 52] etc
