This project applies Deep Q-Learning to the card game Hearts

# Setup & Running

Clone the repository into a local folder. Run the algorithm by navigating to this root folder in the command prompt and typing `python main.py`. 

# Program

Change the hyperparameters at the top of this file to whichever values you choose.
Play the agent against itself, random agents, greedy agents, humans, or a mix, by changing the agent list values in this file.

# The Project

The aim of this project was to apply a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to a game that is difficult for it to learn purposefully, i.e. a multi-agent imperfect information game. Scores are plotted at the end of the iteration.
