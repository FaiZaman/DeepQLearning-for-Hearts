# Training

Tune the rewards, learning rate, gamma, and epsilon
Research an approporiate architecture for the neural network

# Testing

Test the trained agent against random agents, again against greedy agents, an inexperienced human and two random, and an experienced human and two random
Gather results

# Paper
