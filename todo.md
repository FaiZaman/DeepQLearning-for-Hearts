# Training

Tune the rewards, learning rate, gamma, and epsilon
Research an approporiate architecture for the neural network

# Testing

Test the trained agent against random agents, again against greedy agents, an inexperienced human and two random, and an experienced human and two random
Gather results

# This week

Implemented the target network
Optimised and fine-tuned hyperparameters
Designed an optimal architecture for the networks
Gathered some results
Applied feedback and rewrote Abstract, Intro, & Related Work
Finished Solution
Started writing up Results

# Paper

Network Architecture - diagram?
Training - hyperparameter optimisation in solution or results?

Testing 
    - represent as scores (positive with lower being better) or rewards (negative with higher being better) or both?
    - show average score per hand for a better idea or no?

# Software Demo

Slides?
Practice?
List of deliverables? (include double. q?)
Meeting?
